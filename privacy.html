          <h2>What background data is collected?</h2>
          <p>This site does not use any third party tracking scripts.</p>
          <p>To gather data about visits, this site uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Website Analytics</a>. This method does not rely on any client-side state (such as cookies) or any form of fingerprinting to collect information about website visitors. It only provides anonymous statistics on the number of visits to each page, the country of origin of each visit, and basic information about the technology used to access the website (browser, operating system, and type of device).</p>
          <p>I am not doing anything with this data, I am just curious and occasionally like to peek where people came from üòÉ</p>

        <section>
          <h2>How secure is this website?</h2>
          <p>This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider can still see that you are downloading assets from this site, but not its content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data, for example, while browsing on public WiFi, or from network providers injecting advertisements on this site. All relevant response HTTP headers are set for your protection and the Content Security Policy is adjusted to this websites requirements.</p>
